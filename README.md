# Swaad - AI Chatbot: Food-Related Queries<br>
A hackathon project that did not help us win. We did, however, get the consolation prize.

## Basic Information
**What this is:** An AI chatbot with a simple interface trained on reliable recipe and nutrititonal data taken from <a href="https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/">RecipeDB</a>.<br>
**What this does:** Answers recipe, diet, nutrition related queries. Examples below.<br>
**Expected Users:** Anyone looking to cook, or learn about what they're eating.<br><br>
**Tech Stack:** Streamlit, Python.<br>
**Model Used:** Gemini 1.0 Pro. Limited by 30000 tokens, but trained on a much larger dataset through a prompt-engineering workaround.<br><br>

## This can't be run anymore
As of today, Google has changed the way API calls to Gemini are made. Along with this, API key for RecipeDB has also expired. The code needs proper updatation for it to run.
